                    hi all!
                </p>
                <p>
                    i'm <b>anjie</b> and i'm an aspiring developer! i've never received complete, proper, college education in computer science or software engineering, or anything programming related.
                    all my programming knowledge has come from Harvard's CS50 series, of which I've completed the python course (CS50p) and am finishing the intro to computer science (CS50x). this webpage
                    was made and designed by myself, using bootstrap. although i don't have much, as of now, my projects are listed below. if you trust me enough, feel free to download it from github and
                    give it a try :DD
